Learning Goals
--------------
Thermostat is my first Javascript project and chance to use Jasmine test framework, plus JQuery AJAX calls to an API, to dynamically update the application.

It builds upon my first use of Sinatra and CSS/Html whilst extending my familiarity with a TDD object oriented approach.

I may use capybara to extend the test coverage for UI elements. Currently Jasmine tests the back end business logic.

Installation
------------
Javascript is a lightweight interpreted programming language, thus installation is simple. Just download or clone the repo into a local directory. This includes the JQuery and Jasmine libraries, plus OpenWeather API set up.

Once downloaded open SpecRunner.html, confirm there are ```15 specs, 0 failures```.
